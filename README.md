## **JCPS Attendance**
----

Project by Ashley Banks

## What my project is about 
----
### This project contains data that will express the attendance between virtual classes versus in person classes. I expect this project to break down the attendance between the years of in class attendance  for Jefferson County Public Schools.

## Getting the Project to Run

1. Visit Python.org and download Python for your computer, and make sure that version 3.0 of Python is installed on it. Python 3.10.1 was used to complete this project.

2. Once Python has been downloaded, clone the repository from github.

3. Create and launch a virtual environment.


4. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to have pip install the requirements.txt file from within that directory. You may execute the program with confidence knowing that you have the required packages. 

5. After the repo has been copied, utilize File Explorer to find the directory folder where the repo is located.

6. The command prompt will open in that directory once you have navigated to the folder and type "cmd" in the file path line.

7. Run "vs code" on the command line to launch a browser window.

8. Open "JCPSAttendance" in the browser window and click on it to launch the application.

9. After opening the file, select "Run All."

## Requirements
----
1. Inputted data: The project consisted of two csv files, which were read using the pandas function of the pandas Python library.

2. Data manipulation and cleaning: Used in built-in pandas and numpy methods to get rid of data elements like NAN values.

3. Analyze the data by using functions to build new DataFrames, merge DataFrames, and sort additional columns and rows.

4. Data visualization With Matplotlib, create basic, straightforward plots.
